#  Virtual Memory Optimization Challenge  

##  Overview  
This project aims to **analyze and optimize virtual memory usage** using **various page replacement algorithms** like:  
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
- **Optimal Page Replacement**  
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**  

The goal is to **reduce page faults and improve memory efficiency** by comparing these algorithms in different scenarios.
